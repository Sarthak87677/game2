# Project status — Terra Infinite

Resumable task ledger. Update after every completed task. Dates are UTC.

## Current state (2026-09-05)

| Milestone | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Working Earth | **done** | Globe, Terrarium terrain (worker-decoded, cached), offline inferred imagery + optional OSM/Esri/GIBS/MapTiler/ion layers, atmosphere/sun/moon/stars, search (offline gazetteer + coordinates, optional Nominatim/Photon), camera modes, loading/error states, diagnostics. |
| 2. Geographic Structure | **done** | Overpass adapter + OSM buildings (custom night-window shader), towers, roads, rail, water, land use, POI/place labels; bookmarks (246 highlights, 19 showcase areas); DATA_SOURCES/ATTRIBUTIONS; provenance UI; synthetic fixture responder for offline testing. |
| 3. Ground-Level World | **done** | Walk/drive with gravity, terrain, OSM-building and procedural-building collision; tile-anchored local frames (floating origin) for every ground-level mesh; procedural vegetation/rocks/crops/fields/villages/urban blocks generated in a worker from the climate atlas, height fields and OSM (`src/world/procedural`, `src/world/render`). Verified in headless Chromium: 2 572 trees across 15 tiles in the Black Forest, rocks only on the Antarctic ice sheet. |
| 4. Hyperrealistic Nature | **done (first pass)** | 100-species library with hemisphere-aware fruit/flower windows and leaf phenology, leaf cards/needles/palm fronds/fruit at close range, wind-sway vertex shader, weather particles, ground material (snow line, wetness, season tint, cloud shadows, water), ocean surface, orbital + cumulus clouds, underwater fog, procedural ambient audio. Not done: snow accumulation on vegetation geometry, puddles, subsurface leaf translucency. |
| 5. Cities and Landmarks | **done (first pass)** | OSM building meshes with day glass / night window emission, towers, roads, rail, water, land use, POI labels, population night lights, simulated traffic with headlights/tail-lights, street lamps, procedural villages and urban blocks where OSM is absent, 36 landmark stand-ins at measured positions (labelled procedural), 19 showcase areas with tours. Not done: street furniture (benches, signs), road markings, real 3D landmark models (none legally available offline). |
| 6. Optimisation | **in progress** | Budgets in place (tile caches, OSM/near-field radii and LRU unloading, in-flight limits, impostor LOD, vertex caps, request throttling, adaptive presets, ?terraQuality override). `npm run perf` records real numbers; the sandbox only has software WebGL, so the recorded frame rates are SwiftShader numbers, not GPU numbers. |
| 7. Verification & Packaging | **in progress** | 217 unit tests, Playwright suites (smoke, synthetic city, nature, landmarks), production build OK, CI workflow, all docs written. Visually verified frames in `docs/screenshots/`. Last steps: final biome e2e run and `npm run perf` numbers. |

## Verified commands

```
npm run setup      # install, .env, derived data
npm run dev        # http://127.0.0.1:5173
npm run typecheck
npm test           # vitest unit tests
npm run build      # tsc + vite build → dist/
npm run test:e2e   # Playwright (needs a built dist for preview, or TERRA_E2E_DEV=1 for the dev server)
npm run perf       # headless FPS/memory measurement
TERRA_FIXTURES=1 npm run dev   # synthetic OSM responder for offline development
```

## Decisions

* **CesiumJS only** — no second render loop; near-field geometry is built in tile-local ENU frames with per-tile model matrices (floating origin) and Cesium's relative-to-eye encoding.
* **No keys required** — AWS Terrarium terrain + Natural Earth + climate model form the offline baseline; keyed providers are opt-in via `.env`.
* **Inferred climate atlas** — a 1024×512 raster built in a worker from 400+ approximate station normals; documented as inferred everywhere it is shown.
* **Sandbox constraints** — this development environment blocks OSM/Overpass/Nominatim/GIBS/Esri hosts; those adapters are unit-tested with fixtures and exercised through the synthetic responder.

## Known limitations (honest list)

* The development sandbox has no GPU and blocks OSM/Overpass/Nominatim/Esri/GIBS hosts, so real-OSM rendering was validated only through unit tests and the synthetic fixture; frame-rate targets (60/30 fps) could not be measured on real hardware here.
* Terrarium tiles have coarse/odd data in parts of Antarctica and the open ocean; the climate atlas is 39 km resolution.
* The Köppen/biome model is an inference from ~400 approximate station normals; microclimates are not represented.
* Landmarks are abstract procedural interpretations, not models (see `docs/screenshots/eiffel-standin.png`). Vegetation species are archetypes.
* Day/night and slope shading of the terrain come from the ground material (derivative normals); Cesium's own globe lighting is disabled because it only acts beyond 10 000 km and heightmap terrain has no vertex normals.
* Coastal cells of the 39 km climate raster inherit the neighbouring land biome; the vector coastline decides land vs water for readouts and generation.
* Reverse geocoding and live weather need network access and are rate-limited by policy.

## Next task

Run `npm run perf` on a machine with a GPU and paste the table into PERFORMANCE.md; then profile the near-field tile build (mesh merge on the main thread) and move it into the generation worker if it exceeds 16 ms per tile.
